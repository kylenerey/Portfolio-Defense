            When Web Development was introduced to me I felt more interested in coding. I started coding using 'c' language and it really triggered my interest in logic and problem solving.
            But in 'c' I always have to wait for my instructor to give me projects which rarely happens and sometimes I get bored. But when I started learning html and css and started recreating some features of some famous apps like youtube, facebook, and instagram, there is something in me that has woken up and I was really happy with that because in html and css I can build anything I want and that's when I started seeing a future as a Web Developer.

            My journey to studying Information Technology began with a simple curiosity about how computers work. As a child, I often found myself exploring old devices, trying to fix problems without really knowing what I was doing, but I enjoyed the challenge. Over time, that curiosity grew into a passion, especially when I started learning more about programming, websites, and how technology impacts nearly every part of our lives. In high school, I began watching tutorials, joining tech forums, and helping others solve computer issues, which made me realize that IT was more than just a hobbyâ€”it was something I wanted to pursue as a career. Choosing to study IT felt like a natural decision because it matched my interests and gave me the opportunity to keep learning, solving problems, and building things that can make a real difference in the world.
