    <p class="background">My Background</p>
    <p id="background-paragraph">I was born on 3rd of January 2006 in Cebu City. I am the only child in the family. I'm a Capricorn and I love Coding. I have always been passionate about tech ever since so I decided to try my luck in IT field.
      <br><br>
    Aside from being passionate about technology, I am also a someone who's inlove with arts. I do paintings, I draw, and most especially, I love writting in cursive. That I can tell is the very thing i could never live without. Also, I love tidying things, I always keep my environment clean because it relaxes me and help me focus. So before I sit on my desk and start coding, I always make sure everythings neat and clean. I am a very organize person.
